= Your New Site or Blog Feature: Embed Articles? =

This article will try to talk about ways of adding a new unique way site feature of embedding articles to other external blogs or websites. However, before we go through the whole process please take time to read some important information on the technicalities of this embedding procedure.

First we will tackle on if the Open Graph Protocol. What is OPG and what it does to your website or blog? To answer our question we are going to cite some few contents from https://blog.kissmetrics.com/open-graph-meta-tags/ which talks about "What You Need to Know About Open Graph Meta Tags for Total Facebook and Twitter Mastery".

According to this site, Open Graph Protocol was introduced by Facebook in 2010. And added. "It promotes integration between Facebook and other websites by allowing them to become rich "graph" objects with the same functionality as other Facebook objects. Put simply, a degree of control is possible over how information travels from a third-party website to Facebook when a page is shared (or liked, etc.). In order to make this possible, information is sent via Open Graph meta tags in the &lt;head&gt; part of the website's code."

So how does it matter if you are not concerned on Facebook's features or integrated widgets... Google and other large search companies across the web is already and actively supporting this content structured protocol and so to be short it adds more value to your site by providing a more structured content format for your site for ease of indexing and site formatting.

Open Graph Protocol Meta Tags

The OGP meta tags are sets of tags inside your HTML code &lt;head&gt; tag which is actually a summary and structured content of the entire page of your blog or website. To show what these tags look like, we have an example below.

&lt;meta property="og:title" content="The Rock" /><br>
&lt;meta property="og:type" content="article" /><br>
&lt;meta property="og:url" content="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500/" /><br>
&lt;meta property="og:image" content="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/rock.jpg" /><br>
&lt;meta property="og:site_name" content="IMDb" />

og:title - The title of your object as it should appear within the graph, e.g., "The Rock".

og:type - The type of your object, e.g., "article". Depending on the type you specify, other properties may also be required.

og:image - An image URL which should represent your object within the graph.

og:url - The canonical URL of your object that will be used as its permanent ID in the graph, e.g., "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500/".

og:site_name - If your object is part of a larger web site, the name which should be displayed for the overall site. e.g., "IMDb".

Ok! so we have understood OGP, now that we are completely aware of what OGP is we will now talk about the ways on how actually embed articles to your blog or websites.

There are a few websites online that caters the need to embed text-content for publishers and among these few service websites is http://embedarticles.com

How EmbedArticles.com uses OGP to discover article content on a given url or page. With this data they create a simple yet informative embeddable content cards which displays all information about the content in a summarized snippet structure.

According to EmbedArticles, "We extracts and discovers a website through Open Graph [ogp.me] and/or Schemas [schema.org]. Whether from user-generated URL inputs or automated crawlers, EmbedArticles.com examines a given website URL and parse it for schemas and OGP metadata. Once a URL is discovered it will be added to the source list and ready for keyword indexing. Providers are site brands extracted from sources, which simply means Providers are site URL owners or hosts."

They have a current working WordPress plugin which can be downloaded here http://embedarticles.com/wordpress/ and they also have a how-to article section if you are using blogspot.com or blogger, please refer to this url http://embedarticles.com/how/#Blogger

I hope this article is helpful enough to have your site ready and serve your target feature of "Embedding Articles".
