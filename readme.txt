== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need an account on embedarticles.com? =
Yes, you need a API Key from embedarticles.com. Use this link:
<a href="http://embedarticles.com/register/">http://embedarticles.com/register/</a>

= What do I need to do to embed an article? =
Please use the visual and rich text editor buttons: <strong>&lt; &gt;</strong> and [embed_articles]. You can highlight a URL or click the button right on load.

= My button stays at 0 is this OK? =
Yes, that is normal because embeds are counted when an actual embed has actually happened and not on how many clicks the button can recieve.
